# REGISTRY

## Getting Started

The content generated for this app is gotten from [bitcointanscripts](https://github.com/bitcointranscripts/bitcointranscripts).

We employ a git submodule in the public folder to keep this material up to date.

## To run this locally

- Pull down everything using `git clone --recurse-submodules` rather than the standard `git clone` because of the transcript data gotten from submodules.
- Install necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `npm i`
- Run the local development server `npm run dev`
